# Virginia Archaeology: Maps from Different Points of View
### Jolene Smith

#### Middle Atlantic Archaeology Conference 2018


  
**Abstract:** In the years ahead, archaeologists and emergency managers will need increasing capacity to respond to severe weather events driven by climate change. While Virginia’s archaeological geospatial data is generally protected, alternate ways of presenting and sharing information are needed, whether to respond to disasters, to crowdsource observations, or to develop a stewardship ethic among members of the general public. Using data served to the public through the Digital Index of North American Archaeology with obscured location information, this presentation will demonstrate new ways to present and interact with state archaeology records that bring them beyond the world of cultural resource management and regulatory compliance.

  

### Introduction: Expectations for climate change impacts

Argument: our geospatial data is rich and valuable. By finding new ways to view it, we can expand our reach beyond a small subset of trained professionals and exponentially expand our reach and influence, helping sites.

  

### How we plan

\[2\] Long range/general: DINAA PLOS ONE, DHR climate change impact areas to bump up survey

\[1\] Resource specific: Longwood’s coastal change & predictive models

### How we respond

\[1\] Lots of different audiences: From DHR’s point of view

### Risks to sharing too much data

Site location disclosure- looting/vandalism

Overwhelming or misleading non-archaeologists

### Risks to too little data shared

No awareness of risk to heritage resources

No avenue to help

  

### Examples:

\[1\] Audience: other agencies:

#### Agency response map

\[1\] Audience: volunteer condition assessors- leaflet plus kobo form

#### Crowdsourcing conditions- citizen science

\[1\] Audience: general public

#### Sharing information to build coalitions- WHO CARES?

### Ways to present maps to the public

MSUDAI example (could move to COVA)

  

### \[1\] Other exemplars

SCAPE in scotland

### \[1\] Wrap up- 
building in flexibility to view our GIS data in flexible ways can have implications beyond climate change. Also relevant to people outside of DHR. What can you do? Make data interoperable, link it, choose non-proprietary formats for distribution

According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program in November 2017, Virginia sea levels are projected to rise between 1 and 2 meters by the year 2100 ([https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/)). \[also chart there\]. Instability of sea ice introduces even more risk. Differences in mass of land and sea ice produce varying rates of projected rise.
